# Saja Token Exchange

A simple decentralized token exchange named after my little girl, Saja.

## Project Overview

Saja Token Exchange is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to exchange tokens seamlessly. The project comprises a React-based frontend and a Solidity-based backend, utilizing various tools and frameworks to ensure a robust and efficient platform.

## Features

- **Decentralized Token Exchange:** Facilitate peer-to-peer token swaps without intermediaries.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive React frontend for seamless user experience.
- **Smart Contract Backend:** Secure and transparent transactions powered by Solidity smart contracts.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - [React](https://reactjs.org/): JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/): Library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
  - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): CSS framework for responsive design.

- **Backend:**
  - [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/): Programming language for writing smart contracts.
  - [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/): Ethereum development environment for compiling, deploying, testing, and debugging smart contracts.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): JavaScript runtime environment.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): Node package manager (comes with Node.js).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): Version control system.
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/): Browser extension for managing Ethereum wallets.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/larbiii14/Saja-Token-Exchange.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd Saja-Token-Exchange
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Compile Smart Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### 5. Deploy Smart Contracts

Start a local Ethereum node:

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

In a new terminal, deploy the contracts to the local network:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

### 6. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

The application will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Connect Wallet:** Click on the "Connect Wallet" button to connect your MetaMask wallet.
2. **Select Tokens:** Choose the tokens you wish to swap.
3. **Approve Transaction:** Confirm the transaction in MetaMask.
4. **Swap Tokens:** Execute the swap and wait for the confirmation.
